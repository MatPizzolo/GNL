# `Get Next Line`

A function that enables reading a line, terminated by a newline character ('\n'), from a file descriptor.
What sets this project apart is its ability to handle different BUFFER_SIZEÂ´s when using read().

Through this project, we aim to enhance our understanding of memory allocations, including stack and heap memory, as well as the intricate manipulation and life cycle of buffers.
